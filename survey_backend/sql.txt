->So I was facing the problem of sequelize db contraint error and here are the things I used to fix it:
    ->ALWAYS USE MIGRATIONS TO DEVELOP TABLE ESPECIALLY WITH FOREIGN KEY AND RELATIONS
    ->DEVELOP MIGRATIONS FOR PARENT TABLE FIRST AND THEN THE CHILDREN TABLE WITH FOREIGN KEY LATER
    ->PAY ATTENTION TO IMPORTS AND USE CORRECT NAMING CONVENTIONS



->Reset id count in SQL
    ->SELECT MAX(id) from table_name
    ->ALTER TABLE table_name AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
    



->From response fetch service:
    sequelize eager problem was solved by using alias as the model uses it to develop an association between tables
    include:[{
        model:SurveyQuestionModel2,
        as:'question'
    }]


->Fetch unique_studentID for a specific school
    SELECT DISTINCT unique_studentID
    FROM response_1
    WHERE school = 'Rato Bangla School';

Sequelize:
    



->So I have used api for fetching student specific responses in a weird manner i.e for response1 I have 
    used services from fetch.service wheres for fetching from response 2 I have used service from response.service.js
    because I encountered an error regarding eagerloading error while trying to use services from
    fetch service for response 2
